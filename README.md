# Description and Specifications
Project is a refurbished arcade emulator of unknown original origin. The original cabinet contained an old and ruined
dell desktop computer, 28" tube TV, as well as various other parts that were likely destroyed during an electrical surge.

The goal of the project is to repair the machine using a **Raspberry Pie 3 B+** and the **RetroPie** emulation software
to modernize and increase longevity of the cabinet.

# Items and Costs
|Items                |Costs    |
| ------------------- | :-----: |
| Raspberry Pie 3 B+  | $ 54.99 |
| PS2 to USB converter| $ 6.98  |
| 28" Flatscreen TV   | N/A     |
| 128 GB mini SD card | N/A     |

# Possible Future Additions
1. Add more games to the software
2. Learn basic woodworking skills to add shelves and dividers for adding other physical retro consoles to the cabinet
  * An example of this is creating space in the panel housing the control board (fig. 2), placing a Nintendo 64
    console in it, and cutting a hole in it to exchange cartridges
3. Use a cluster of Raspberry Pies to increase emulation power
